So I decided to have another blog. Because I did not want to host my own wordpress instance like in the old days, and tumblr is painfully slow in China, I decided to use github instead although a static website maybe somewhat primitive these days. Since there are services such as google analytics and disqus, which can be integrated easily with simple JavaScript codes, a wordpress instance is not really necessary. 

After a bit of research, Jekyll became my choice of the management tool of this blog. It is fairly easy to set up under my debian VM. Simply "apt-get install rubygems" and "gem install jekyll" will get the job done. The default theme looks fine to me, so I am going to use it without modification for now.

English is and will be used as the language of this blog because I really want to improve my English writing skills. 

Today is September 26th. I just had my Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival holiday several days ago. Weather is cooling down in Hefei. It feels good:)
